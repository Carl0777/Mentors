        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in December 2024, MentorMyCoding was born out of a desire to make coding education more accessible and effective. We recognized the 
            challenges many learners face – from feeling overwhelmed by vast amounts of information to struggling with finding the right guidance. 
            Our solution is simple: bring together experienced mentors and eager learners to form meaningful, supportive, and impactful relationship.
            Over the years, we have built a vibrant community of mentors and mentees who work together to not only enhance technical skills but also foster a sense 
            of confidence and independence in their coding abilities.
